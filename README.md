A C2 framework built for my bachelors thesis at KEA - KÃ¸benhavns Erhvervsakademi - **WORK IN PROGRESS - expect bugs and missing features**

I work on this project in my spare time when i am not working or doing other security stuff, i am by no means a skilled coding genuis, but i love to learn and improve :) If you have any suggestions for me or feedback i would love to hear it, you can reach me on my socials. 


## Installation 
To get the dependencies installed and the server ready to go, it's needed to run the setup script and a few manual commands.

git clone `PrimusC2`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Primusinterp/PrimusC2.git
```
cd into `PrimusC2` and chmod the bash script
```bash
sudo chmod +x setup.sh
```
run the setup script with source
```bash
source setup.sh
```

Install nim (use your preferred method) -I recommend [choosenim](https://nim-lang.org/install_unix.html)

Install nim packages:
```
nimble install -y winim 
nimble install -y shlex 
nimble install -y terminaltables
nimble install -y RC4
nimble install -y puppy
nimble install -y byteutils
```
Run the server from the C2 folder:
```bash
sudo -E python3 server.py
```
*If any issues arise while running the nimplant command, try and compile the implant manually to see errors*

## Features
- Python C2 server 
- Nim Implant 
- Bypass AMSI
- Directory Operations
- Download functionality 
- Execute .NET assembly - *Risky*
- Powershell in unmanaged runspace
- GetAV - current anti-virus products installed 
- Powershell download cradle 
- Dynamic implant generation 
- Automated Redirector setup via Digital Ocean VPS(Smart-Pipe & Dump-Pipe)
- Web Interface


## Usage
The following functionality is implemented in PrimusC2's current state:

*Beware that some features are only supported with the HTTP implant*
```bash
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Menu Commands
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    listener -g <TYPE>          --> Generate a HTTP or TCP listener
    nimplant -g <TYPE>          --> Generate a compiled exe payload written in nim with advanced capabilities for windows for either TCP or HTTP
    callbacks                   --> List callbacks
    use <callback ID> [use 0]   --> Enter a callback session
    pwsh_cradle                 --> Generate a pwsh cradle for a payload on the payloads server
    kill <sessions_val>         --> Terminate active callback
    payloads                    --> List payloads available on for either transfer or execution
    exit                        --> exit from the server
    help <command>              --> Get help for a specific command

    Implant Commands
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    background                  --> Backgrounds current sessions
    exit                        --> Terminate current session
    GetAV                       --> Get the current AV running
    pwsh <COMMAND>              --> Load CLR and run powershell in unmanaged runspace 
    execute-ASM <file> <args>   --> Execute .NET assembly from memory   
    ls                          --> List files in current directory
    cd <dir>                    --> Change current working directory
    pwd                         --> Print current working directory
    payloads                    --> List payloads available on for either transfer or execution
    shell <COMMAND>             --> Run Windows CMD commands on target
    sleep <milseconds>          --> Adjust callback time [Default 5000] - HTTP only
    persist <k_name> <payload>  --> Deploy registry persistance to run a payload on startup(OPSEC: RISKY) - HTTP only
    download <file>             --> Download file from target(dont use "" around file name or path) - HTTP only
    help <command>              --> Get help for a specific command

```
